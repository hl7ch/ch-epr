### Introduction
This FHIR速 implementation guide contains terminology that is used in Switzerland for the core profiles, various exchange formats and also in the context of the Swiss electronic patient record (EPR). See also [fhir.ch](https://fhir.ch/).

The EPR metadata is specified in the Annexes of the Swiss EPR [FDHA Ordinance](https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/de/home/gesetze-und-bewilligungen/gesetzgebung/gesetzgebung-mensch-gesundheit/gesetzgebung-elektronisches-patientendossier.html) on the electronic patient record in Switzerland.    
The EPR artifacts are based on the [CH-EPR](http://ehealthsuisse.art-decor.org/index.php?prefix=ch-epr-) [ART-DECOR](https://www.art-decor.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page) project which has been [published by eHealth Suisse](http://ehealthsuisse.art-decor.org/).
